Dynamic and interpreted Programming Language
- Not pre-compiled, instead parsed and compiled on the fly
- Code evaluated and executed at runtime
- Code can chane at runtime (e.g. type of a variable)

Weakly-typed Programming Language
- Data types are assumed automatically
- You don't define that some variable has to hold a certain value
- Data types are not set in stone but can change
