What is JavaScript?
- A dynamic, interpreted, and weakly-typed programming language which is compiled at runtime.
- It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine / host environment
- Made to make webpages more dynamic
- Used to be called LiveScript

How do webpages work?
- User interacts with Client (Browser)
- At initial visit to the webpage, a request is sent to a server then the server loads that webpage and sends it back to the browser (Response)
- For example, a user clicks a button to submit a form. This triggers a new request to the server, and the server then again returns a response.

How JavaScript is executed?
- A JavaScript engine is built in whatever environment it runs.
- Job of the engine is to parse code and on-the-fly, compile it to machine code, and then execute that machine code.
- All this happens on a single thread.

JavaScript vs Java
- Totally independent programming languages with different syntax and principles
* Java
    - Not supported directly in the browser
    - Strictly object-oriented and strongly-typed
* JavaScript
    - Flexible, weakly-typed
    - Was name JavaScript to "sound cool"

Client-side vs Server-side
- Syntax and core-features are exactly the same
* Client-side
    - Origin of JS
    - Different browser vendors provide their own JS execution engines
    - Allows interaction with webpage and browser APIs
* Server-side
    - Why not use JS outside of the browser? Allows for code and knowledge re-usage
    - Extracted V8 engine to run JS anywhere
    - Special non-browser APIs (e.g. to work with file system, incoming HTTP requests, etc.)

Brief history of JS
- (1995) Netscape intoduces LiveScipt, renamed to JavaScript
- (1996) Microsoft releases its own version for IE
- (Late 1996) JS was submitted to ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) to start standardization
- (1997 - 2005) Standardization efforts, Microsoft didn't really join and support the standardized JS version though
- (2006 - 2011) Huge progress in JS ecosystem, Microsoft eventually joined forces

JS and ECMAScript
- JS is the most famous ECMAScript implementation
- ECMAScript isn't directly used but browser vendors implement the standard into their engines
- Each browser comes with its own JS engine that also defines which features are actually supported
- ECMAScript is under active development. They are continuously shaping the language along with JS
