Constructor Functions vs Classes

Constructor functions
- blueprint for objects
- hold properties and methods
- a function which can be called together with the new keyword
  to create an object based on it
- can be called with "new"
- all properties and methods are enumerable (can be called in for-in loop)
- not in strict mode by default

Classes
- blueprint for objects
- hold properties and methods
- gave us an easy way to write bluepring definitions
- exactly like constructor functions but is just syntactical sugar at the
  end of the day
- MUST be called with "new"
- Methods are NON-ENUMERABLE (cannot be called in for-in loop)
- ALWAYS in strict mode
