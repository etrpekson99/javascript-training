Constructor Functions vs Classes

Constructor functions
- blueprint for objects
- hold properties and methods
- a function which can be called together with the new keyword
  to create an object based on it

Classes
- blueprint for objects
- hold properties and methods
- gave us an easy way to write bluepring definitions
- exactly like constructor functions but is just syntactical sugar at the
  end of the day
