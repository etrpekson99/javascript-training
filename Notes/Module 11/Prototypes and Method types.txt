Method Shorthand
- assigned to Person's prototype and hence shared across all instances (NOT re-created per instance).

class Person {
    greet() {
        console.log('hello);
    }
}

Property Function
- assigned to individual instances and hence RE-CREATED per object. "this"
  refers to "what called the method".

class Person {
    greet = function() { ... }
    constructor() {
        this.greet2 = function() { ... }
    }
}

Property Arrow Function
- assigned to individual instances and hence RE-CREATED per object. "this" always refers to the instance

class Person {
    greet = () => { ... }
    constructor() {
        this.greet2 = () => { ... }
    }
}
