for example we have a class or constructor function:
class Person { ... }

then we initialize an new instance of it:
const p = new Person();

and we call a method that could or could not be in the Person() class:
p.breathe()

first, JS will check if breathe() is defined in Person itself
(i.e. set up in the blueprint)

if yes, then JS will execute the function

if no, the JS will look to the prototype:
p.__proto__.breathe() -> this is basically the base class of the Person object

JS will check if it exists in the prototype

if yes, then JS will execute that

if no, then JS will look to the prototype of the prototype:
p.__proto__.__proto__.breathe()

....this continues until Object.prototype which is the GLOBAL "Object"

The default prototype of every object can be found on the global Object()

The FALLBACK object of every object is NOT Object(), but Object.prototype

Object.prototype has no prototype itself

__proto__ points to the prototype assigned to the object. This is available on every object

The prototype property allows us to configure what will be added to objects
that are created based on a constructor function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prototype does not exist on EVERY object. It exists on FUNCTION objects.
