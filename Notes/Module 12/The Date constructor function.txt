new Date()
- gives us the current date and timestamp
- we can store it in a constant -> const date = new Date();

date.getDate()
- gives us the day in month

date.getDay()
- get the day in week

date.getTime()
- get the time in milliseconds since January 1st, 1970
- can be helpful when calculating differences

we can pass to new Date() that JS tries to parse:
const date2 = new Date('07/11/19')

(date - date2) / 1000 / 60 / 60 / 24 -> give us the difference in days
