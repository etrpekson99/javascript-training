throw new Error('something went wrong')
- the string will be the error
- we can throw anything as an error, which will cause an error
- but it is better to throw an error with the Error() constructor function
- this can also show where the error was thrown, therefore giving us more information
- since it's an object, we can add stuff to it, therefore we can add extra information
