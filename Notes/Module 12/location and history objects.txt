location
- contains data about the URL of our page
- allows us to edit browser history

location.href
- navigate to a given page that we assign to it

location.replace
- we can't go back if we set a page using this because it replaces it in the browser history

location.assign
- works the same as location.href, but this one is a method

location.host
- tells us which host the page is running / the domain

---------------------------------------------------------------
history
- allows us to interact with browser history

history.back
- takes us back to the page we came from

history.go(x)
- take the user back x number of pages from where they are now

history.length
- how many steps the user did in a tab in the browser

!!important: moving the user around may not provide with the best UX, so use these functions with care
