EVERY FUNCTION IN JAVASCRIPT IS A CLOSURE

*Section 15, video #328

Why?

Each function has its own lexical environment,
and the variables and/or arguments are registered in these environments.

In JS, every function is a closure because it "closes over"
the variables defined in its environment and it "memorizes"
them so they're not thrown away when we don't need them
in the surrounding context anymore.
