Every number is a float (a floating point number), a number w/ decimal places.

Unlike other programming languages, JS does not know special integer types.

Numbers like 5, -3, or 12 would actually be stored like 5.0, -3.0, or 12.0 respectively.

Numbers are stored as 64 Bit Floating points in JS
- there are 64 Bits available to internally represent a number
- due to this fact, there are certain limits in JS
- there is a max and minimum number
- we can't represent EVERY number in JS

We must always be aware of the fact that there are limits to
representing numbers in JS.

JS will give us an imprecise result when we try
to calculate with the highest values that can
be represented in JS.
