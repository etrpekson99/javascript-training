The browser takes care of async code JS passes to it
and manages them in multiple threads.

"JS is single-threaded but offloads longer-taking tasks to the browser which is multi-threaded"

callback() functions are the functions called by the browser
once it is done executing the asynchronous code, allowing us
to "step back" into our script.
