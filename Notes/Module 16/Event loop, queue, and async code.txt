Event loop
- helps us deal with async code and callback functions
- built into the browser and in other JS host environments
- its job is to synchronize the call stack in the engine
  with our waiting messages in our message queue
- it checks if the stack is empty, then it pushes any waiting
  "to-do" functions into the call stack

message queue
- in here, the browser registers any code once there is time
  for it
- tasks in here are "to-do"
