Server
- may run on different server (different domain)
- responsible for storing and retrieving data (with database)

Frontend
- detached from backend
- on the FE, we do not connect directly to a database

The communication between Server and Frontend happen with
HTTP Requests / Responses
- these requests / responses have to be configured in a certain way
- when we send a request, it needs to know the URL (domain + path)
  URL: my-page.com/posts
  Domain: my-page.com
  Path: /posts
- each request has a method assigned to it; they describe what we
  want to do, but the server is still responsible for doing what it
  needs to do. It is also the job of the server to decide which
  methods will be supported for the FE to use
- HTTP headers are extra metadata that can be attached to requests
- some requests require an HTTP body (data)
