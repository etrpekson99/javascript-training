Some things we should keep in mind when working with libraries:
- when we add a library, we include all of its functions,
  including ones that we will never use. we download more
  than we need
- we want to make sure we're working with libraries that are
  secure and ACTIVELY MAINTAINED
- we don't want to add a package that adds a security hole
- we want to make sure there's ACTIVE support for the library,
  so we can easily find help when we encounter bugs that's
  related to the library
