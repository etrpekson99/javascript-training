What is a third-party library?
- does not matter whether we're working with
  JS in the browser or in a different environment
  like NodeJS
- helps us with utility functions that we don't have
  to write on our own anymore
- packages of code and functions written in JS that can
  be used in our own code
- takes away some of the complexity from our core project
  or core business logic
