Data Types
* Numbers
    - negative numbers and numbers with decimal places (floats)
* Strings (Text)
    - important for outputting results, gathering user input, displaying messages, etc
* Booleans
    - only either true or false
* Objects
    - allows you to group data
* Arrays
    - simply a list of data

null / undefined / NaN
- special values
- null and undefined are both data types
* undefined
    - declared variables where you haven't assigned a value yet are undefined
    - you should NEVER assign undefined as a value manually
* null
    - value for variables where you never assigned a NEW value
    - never a default value
    - you CAN assign this is a value if you want to "reset" or "clear" a variable
* NaN (Not a Number)
    - NOT a type
    - kind of a number and can be used in calculations
    - yields NaN if used in a calculation that is invalid (e.g. 3 / "hi")
