defer attribute added to <script> tags
- tells the browser that it should download the scripts right away
  but it should not block parsing HTML, and only execute the scripts
  after all parsing is finished

async attribute added to <script> tags
- it tells the browser to start loading the scripts as early as possible,
  and then the browser is not blocked but it continues parsing HTML, but the
  difference to defer is that with async, the script executes right away once
  it is downloaded
- a script will execute as early as possible, so the order of script execution is
  not guaranteed

Both defer and async are only available when you have an external script
It won't work when the JS is embedded in the HTML code
You also cannot combine inline and external scripts
