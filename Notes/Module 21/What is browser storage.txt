The server and the browser are the two entities communicating
when we have a webpage.

Servers store essential and persistent data, like emails and passwords

Browsers store temporary, "convenience" data
- localStorage & sessionStorage
  - simple key-value store, like a JS object with key-value pairs
  - manage user preferences or basic user data
  - can be cleared by the user and via JS
  - easy to use, quite versatile, but bad for complex data
- Cookies
  - simple key-value store that can be configured in various ways
  - manage user preferences or basic user data
  - can be cleared by the user and via JS
  - a bit clunky to use, quite versatile
  - sent to the server with outgoing HTTP requests
  - bad for complex data
- IndexedDB
  - relatively sophisticated, client-side database
  - manage complex data your web app needs
  - can be cleared by the user and via JS
  - a bit clunky to use
  - good performance
