Solution: feature detection + fallback code
For example, the navigator.clipboard API

Check if feature is available, execute the code and use feature.

If not available, execute fallback code, show error message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution: using Polyfills
A polyfill is a third-party package that adds an unsupported
feature to the browser (for this script execution)

A polyfill "teaches" the browser how to use the feature

This is only possible possible for some features (i.e where
you can re-create the missing functionality)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution: Using transpilation

Typical for features like let, const, async/await, arrow functions, etc.

Convert ("transpile") modern code to "older" code

Third-party tools like Babel convert your code to code that works in older
browsers as well

Write modern code, user cutting-edge features -> Ship (deploy) cross-browser code

npm i --save-dev babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env

browsersList is a configuration that allows us to set which browsers we will support
and will transpile our code to

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvement: automatically detect + add polyfills

corejs is a package with all polyfills

useBuiltIns: 'entry' would load all polyfills that we need to meet
the specification we put in the browsersList configuration

What about non-browser environments like NodeJS?

We control which version of JS / NodeJS we use

If a feature is available, you can use it.
