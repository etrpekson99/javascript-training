Solution: feature detection + fallback code
For example, the navigator.clipboard API

Check if feature is available, execute the code and use feature.

If not available, execute fallback code, show error message.

Solution: using Polyfills
A polyfill is a third-party package that adds an unsupported
feature to the browser (for this script execution)

A polyfill "teaches" the browser how to use the feature

This is only possible possible for some features (i.e where
you can re-create the missing functionality)
