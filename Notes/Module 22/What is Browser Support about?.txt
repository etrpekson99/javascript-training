What exactly is browser support?

We, the developers, want to use latest JS features like fetch()
We can't control which browser your users use

There's a broad variety of browsers that users can user

Browser features vs JS syntax
- they are related but not exactly the same

Browser features (Browser APIs)
- the browser "decides" which features it offers
- examples: fetch(), geolocation, DOM API, etc.
- implemented individually

JS Syntax
- the browser's JS engine defines which JS syntax/version is supported
- examples: let, const, async/await, Promises, etc.
- implemented individually or in chunks (e.g. ES6)
- there is a way of writing code in the latest JS syntax and compiling it
  to older JS so that other browsers may support it; for DOM APIs,
  that's not really possible

Not all browsers support all features, and support changes all the time in modern ("evergreen")
browsers. Legacy browsers (e.g. IE8) do not receive new features anymore.
