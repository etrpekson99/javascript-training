Naive thought: support ALL browsers and ALL browser versions
- DON'T DO THIS

There are super older versions of IE that don't support ANYTHING

Don't build an application for the smallest possible denomenator

Analyze your market. Who will be your users?

For example, we are building an internal tool / app:
- company browser might be clearly defined

For tech-savvy users:
- very likely to use cutting-edge browsers and versions

Older people, non-tech-savvy audience
- likely to use older browsers
