The idea behind React.js

A JS library for building user-interfaces

It started a hige ecosystem, effectively forming a pseudo-framework

Uses a declarative approach:
we define the result, not the steps that lead to the result

Opposite of that is an imperative approach, where we define all the steps to achieve the result

We define components (JS functions or classes) and build our UI with these components
