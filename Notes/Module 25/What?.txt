Symbols
- primitive values
- used as object property identifiers (keys)
- built-in and creatable by developers
- uniqueness is guaranteed

Iterators & Generators
- allow us to create our own "loopable" values
- an Iterator is an object which has a "next" method that returns a result
  of a certain structure
- iterators allow us to loop through any field in an object
- a Generator builds us an iterator object (one with a next() method built in)

Reflect API
- API that allows us to control objects
- added recently with ES6
- has two advantages over the Object API:
  - returns a better error or true or false if the method worked
  - it bundles all features that we need to work with objects, for
    example the deleteProperty method which is not available in the
    Object API

Proxy API
