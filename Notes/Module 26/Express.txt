Express is a middleware-driven framework

Express is all about funneling the incoming requests
through a bunch of different functions which all receive
the request, and can all do something with it.

Each function can stop the request and send back a response,
at which point the request will not reach any other function
or any other middleware.

Or a function can forward a request to the next function
