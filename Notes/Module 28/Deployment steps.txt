Different kinds of applications / websites

Only HTML + JS + CSS
- can be deployed to a static host (doesn't execute 
  server-side code) suffices
- to be deployed in a server that can't execute NodeJS
- server needs to host + provide HTML, JS, and CSS assets
- example services: AWS S3, Firebase hosting, etc

Server-side code (NodeJS)
- need dynamic host (able to execute server-side NodeJS)
- server needs to host + execute filtes (server-side)
- example services: AWS elastic beanstalk, Heroku, etc

Deployment steps
- develop / write code
- test
- optimize
- build for production
- deploy output

For server-side code, code optimization and building for production
is not too necessary.

Deploying with firebase: (client-side)
firebase init
firebase deploy

Deploying with Heroku: (server-side)
deploy with Git
