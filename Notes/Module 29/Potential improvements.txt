Runtime performance
- avoid unnecessary code executions
- batch operations together if possible
- find + fix memory leaks, even small ones
- for high-frequency operations: use optimal JS approach (re-validate regularly)
- CONSIDER micro-optimizations

Startup performance
- eliminate unnecessary / unused code
- avoid using too many libraries
- potentially add third-party libraries to bundle instead of CDN
- bundle code and use lazy loading
- minify code

DON'T overdo it. We don't want to optimize every single bit of code.
