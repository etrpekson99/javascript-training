What is performance?
categorized into two main categories:

Startup time
- how long does it take to see something on the screen?
- how quickly is a user able to interact with the page?

Runtime performance
- How smooth does the application run? Are there freezes or lags?
- How smooth do animations play? Is there any visual lag?
- Are there any memory leaks? Is the page getting slower over time?

Performance is not just about JS

It is influenced by a lot of factors. CSS code, HTML code, and of course also JS code.
Also influenced by server speed / config.

- primarily related to browser-side JS
