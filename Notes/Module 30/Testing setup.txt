We need three kinds of tools:

Test runner
- needed for unit + integration testing
- executes our test, summarizes the results
- e.g. Mocha, Jest

Assertion library
- needed for unit + integration testing
- defines testing logic, conditions
- e.g. Chai, Jest

Headless browser
- needed mostly for E2E testing
- simulates browser interaction
- e.g. Puppeteer
