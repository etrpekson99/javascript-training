What is testing?
We have our code, and we have an expected result.

Why does it matter?
We automate so we don't have to test everything manually
in our application.

Why test?
- get an error if we break our code
- save time
- think about possible issues and bugs
- can integrate tests into our build workflow
- break up complex dependencies; write code that we can split it
- improves our code since we are forced to follow
  certain patterns or write code in a certain way

Different kinds of tests

Fully-isolated (e.g. testing one function)
- unit tests
- write thousands of these

With dependencies (e.g. testing a function that calls a function)
- integration tests
- write a good couple of these

Full flow (e.g. validating the DOM after a click)
- end-to-end (E2E) tests
- write a few of these

Complexity increases from unit tests to E2E tests.
Frequency increases from E2E tests to unit tests, so we would
have a LOT of unit tests.
