What are programming paradigms?
- how we write or organize our code
- not a syntax or feature; really just how we reason about
  the program we're writing

Object-oriented programming
- organized data and logic in objects (properties + methods)
- everything in our code gets represented as a Class, and in the end,
  as an object
- organize code in logical entities

Procedural programming
- write sequentiel series of execution steps / tasks
- top to bottom code exectution

Functional programming
- organize code in (pure) functions with clearly defined tasks
- pass data around via parameters
