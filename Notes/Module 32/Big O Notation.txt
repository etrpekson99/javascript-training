"how long does an operation take?"

Expressed in a generalized form (NOT in time units but in math terms)

We use something called Time Complexity

O(n)
... n = number of affected elements

We typically look at the best case or the common case.

What matters to us are the parts of the algorithm that vary
based on the input size, because that is what will scale
up or down.
