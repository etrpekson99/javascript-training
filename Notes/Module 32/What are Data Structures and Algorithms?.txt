What are algorithms?
- the sequence of steps we need to derive a desired
  output with a given input

What are data structures?
- piece of data that follows certain rules, like an array

Why do these matter?
- more complex programs may require more sophisticated data
  storage solutions and computation logic
- In addition, we must be able to thing logically as a programmer -
  get a "problem solving" attitude
