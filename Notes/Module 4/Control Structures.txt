Control structures
- you don't always want to execute the same code from top to bottom
- or you may want to run the same code but you don't want to write them over and over

Conditional expressions / Ternary operators
- If statements return NO values
- Use ternary operator in such cases
  const userName = isLogin ? 'Max' : null;

Statements vs Expressions
- Expressions yield a value
- Every expression is a statement
- Not every statement is an expression
- An example of a statement that isn't and expressions is the if statement

Behind the scenes, switch statements always use the triple equal (===)
operator to compare values
