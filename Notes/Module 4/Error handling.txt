Some errors can't be avoided (beyond your control as a developer)
examples:
- User input errors
- Network errors
- etc...

Best you can do is throw and catch errors to fail gracefully or recover if possible

Can be done with:
try {...} catch(error) {...}

Wrapping your whole code in a try block is not good for performance
