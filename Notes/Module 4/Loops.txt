Loops
- Executes code multiple times with a given condition; in a more dynamic way

for loop
- execute code a certain amount of times (with counter variable)
- e.g.
  for (let i =0; i < 3; i++) {
      console.log(i);
  }

for-of loop
- execute for every element in an array
- does not give you direct access to the index
- built to work with arrays
- e.g.
  for (const el of array) {
      console.log(el);
  }

for-in loop
- execute for every key in an object
- built to work with objects
- e.g.
  for (const key in obj) {
      console.log(key);
      console.log(obj[key]);
  }

while loop
- execute code as long as a condition is true
- e.g.
  while (isLoggedIn) {
      ...
  }

Infinite loop
for(;;)

The "continue" key word will skip a given iteration of the loop and will
not execute any code after it.
e.g.
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}

Output:
0
1
2
4

The iteration for 3 will not happen, and it will not execute the console.log(),
instead it will move on to the next iteration.
