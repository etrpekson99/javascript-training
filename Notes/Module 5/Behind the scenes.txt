ES - ECMAScript
JavaScript is a specific version of ECMAScript

ES5 (and older)
- Supported in basically all browser, including old IE
- only had var for creating variables, not let and const
- Generally same syntax as ES6, but quite some missing features

ES6 (and newer): Modern JS
- Supported in modern browsers, can (mostly) be transpiled to ES5
- Most modern browsers update automatically when the JS version is updated
- Many new features that help us write cleaner, better, and faster code
- Still under active development, but ES6 was a big step forward

* var
    - creates a variable
    - Available ever since
    - Function and global scope

Block scope
- let and const are Block Scoped
- var only knows global scope and function scope
- let and const care about the "curly braces", which are statements (ifs, loops, etc.)
- let and const forces us to write cleaner and better code
- we no longer use var in modern JS
- Blocks are created by curly braces (except in objects)

Hoisting
- JS engine goes over your entire script and registers functions and variables
- variables created by var pulls the initialization to the top of the script
- for let and const, it does the same but it doesn't intialize any value to it

Modern JS disables certain features that would work without strict mode
