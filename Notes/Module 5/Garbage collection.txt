Garbage collection

How is the heap memory managed?
- using the garbage collector

What does the garbage collector do?
- periodically checks Heap memory for unused objects (objects without references)
- the garbage collector removes unused objects
- we cannot trigger garbage collection on our own

Beware of memory leaks
- unused objects where you still hold references to
