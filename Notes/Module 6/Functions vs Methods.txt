Functions stored in an object are called methods.

An example of a method is the addEventListener function

All methods are functions but not all functions are methods.

example of a method:
const person = {
    greet: function greet() {
        console.log('hello');
    }
}

person.greet();

Functions are also objects!

When a function is stored in a variable, the implication is that
the function is still created, but the function is no longer stored
in the function name, but in the name of the constant it is
assigned to.
