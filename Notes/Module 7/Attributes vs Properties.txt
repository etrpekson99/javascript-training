Often (but not always), attributes are mapped to properties and
"live synchronization" is set up.

example:
<input id="input-1" class="input-default" value="Enter text" />

id="input-1", class="input-default", and value="Enter text" are all considered attributes.
Everything placed in HTML code, on element tags are considered attributes.

What the browser does with these attributes is it creates such a DOM object based
on the tag name and pre-configures some of its properties based on these attributes.

The Property is a value stored in the object that's created based on your HTML code.

const input = document.getElementById("input");
The properties are the ff:
input.id (1:1 mapping + live-sync)
input.className (different names but live-sync)
input.value (1:1 mapping and 1-way live-sync)
etc..

Not every attribute has a 1-to-1 mapping in properties.
