HTML string
- innerHTML -> add (render) HTML string
- insertAdjacentHTML() -> add (render) HTML string in specific position

createElement
- this allows us to easily access newly-created elements, as opposed to when adding
  new elements using HTML strings
- appendChild() / append() -> append new DOM element / node
- prepend(), before(), after(), insertBefore() -> insert new DOM element / node in specific position
- replaceChild(), replaceWith() -> replace existing DOM element / node with a new one

If we have an element selected, if, for example, we append it first, and then
prepend it later on, it will be moved from the place it was appended to to the
new place it's been prepended to. It is not "copied", it is moved.
