Query Methods

* document.querySelect(<CSS selector>);
- takes any CSS selector (e.g. '#some-id', '.some-class', or 'div p.some-class')
  and returns the FIRST matching element in the DOM.
- returns null if no matching element could be found

* document.getElementById(<ID>);
- takes an ID (without #, just the id name) and returns the element that
  has this id
- since the same ID shouldn't occur more than once on your page, it'll always
  return exactly that one.
- returns null if no element with the specified ID could be found

* document.querySelectorAll(<CSS selector>);
- takes any CSS selector (e.g. '#some-id', '.some-class', or 'div p.some-class')
  and returns ALL matching elements in the DOM as a static (non-live) NodeList
- returns an empty NodeList if no matching element could be found

* document.getElementByClassName(<CSS CLASS>);
- takes a CSS class (e.g. 'some-class') and returns a live HTMLCollection
  of matched elements in your DOM
- returns an empty HTMLCollection if no matching elements were found

* document.getElementsByTagName(<HTML TAG>);
- takes an HTML tag (e.g. 'p') and returns a live HTMLCollection of matched elements
  in your DOM
- returns an empty HTMLCollection if no matching elements were found
