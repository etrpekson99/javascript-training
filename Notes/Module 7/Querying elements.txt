querySelector(), getElementById()
- return single elements
- different ways of querying elements (by CSS selector, by ID, respectively)
- direct reference to DOM element is returned because remember that DOM nodes
  are just JS objects in the end

querySelectorAll(), getElementsByTagName(), etc..
- return collections of elements (array-like objects): NodeList
- different ways of querying elements (by CSS selector, b tag name, by CSS class)
- querySelectorAll() returns a non-live NodeList
- getXByY methods return live NodeLists

querySelector can let us target individual elements on our screen

When using these queries, it is important that we have already parsed our
HTML code already.
