DOM
- Document Object Model

Browser
- When the HTML file is downloaded, the browser parses it and renders it
- exposes Web API to allow JS to work with the parsed document, this is what's
  called the "Document Object Model" (DOM)

DOM is not strictly tied to browsers.
There are other tools that can parse HTML.

The browser parses the HTML code and creates an object representation.
For example, the <html> tag is translated to an HTML node, which is an element
node which represents the <html> tag.

The browser also creates a tree of nodes with the HTML node as the main parent node.
The browser keeps track of parent-child relations you have between different HTML
elements, and it does so by making a node tree.

All text that we have are also translated into text nodes.
