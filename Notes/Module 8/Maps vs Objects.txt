Maps vs Objects

Maps
- can use ANY values (and types) as keys
- better performance for large quantities of data
- better performance when adding or removing data frequently

Objects
- Only may use string, numbers or symbols as keys
- perfect for small / medium-sized sets of data
- can have methods that can interact with data in the object, which isn't possible with maps
- easier / quicker to create (typically also with better performance)
