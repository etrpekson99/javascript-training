"this" will always refer to whatever executes the function.

const newMovie = {
      getTitle() {
        return this.info.title;
      }
   };

if we call getTitle() like this:
newMovie.getTitle()
"this" will then refer to newMovie

if we try to extract getTitle() like this:
const { getTitle } = newMovie;
"this" will be the global execution context, in this case it 
is the global execution object
