What are objects?
- core data structure in JS
- typically reflect "real-world" entities
- allow us to apply real-world logic to coding
- made up of properties and methods
- store data in properties and actions in methods
- allow us to group related data and split our code into logical pieces
- ONLY objects are reference values
  - { ... } -> object literals
  - DOM nodes
  - Arrays
  - anything that isn't a primitive value
