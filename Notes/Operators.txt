Operators
- syntax feature in JS that allows us to manipulate values
- Exponentation (e.g. 2 ** 3 = 8)
- JS follows normal mathematical rules such as PEMDAS

variable++
- this will add 1 to the variable
- when assigned to a variable, this will return the value before the change so:
    - if variable = 0, then you use variable++, it will return 0 which is the
      value BEFORE the change happened

++variable
- will also add 1 to the variable
- when assigned to a variable, this will return the value after the change so:
    - if variable = 0, then you use ++variable, it will return 1 which is the
      value AFTER the change happened

typeof
- lets you evaluate the type of a variable at runtime
- returns a string
- there is no "array" type, instead typeof [] will return "object" since arrays are just
  a special type of object in JS, same as null
- typeof undefined is "undefined"
- typeof NaN is "number"
