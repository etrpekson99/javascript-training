Variables and Constants
* Variables
    - a Variable is a data container or data storage
    - the value can change in a variable
* Constants
    - a data container/ storage as well
    - the value of a constant cannot be changed

You typically want to use constant as often as possiible to be clear about your intentions in your code.

Variable Naming
- JS is case-sensitive
* Allowed
    let userName
    - best practice: camelCase
    let ageGroup5
    - only letters and digits
    $kindOfSpecial
    - starting with $ is allowed
    _internalValue
    - starting with _ is allowed

* Not allowed
    let user_name
    - allowed BUT bad practice
    let 12Players
    - must NOT start with digits
    let user-b
    - no special characters
    let let
    - keywords are not allwed

JS code is executed from top to bottom

Converting Data types
* To convert strings to numbers we can either use: 
    - parseInt(variable)
    - +variable
- parseInt or parseFloat is just more intentional
* To convert numbers to strings we can use:
    - variable.toString()

"+" is the only arithmetic operator that also supports strings since it will
concatenate strings and numbers by default. But for other operators it will treat
it as such:
3 * '3' = 9 (9 is a number, not a string)
3 - '3' = 0 (0 is a number, not a string)
3 / '3' = 1 (1 is a number, not a string)

Only 3 + '3' yields '33' because JS, by default, is going to concatenate the string
and the number
